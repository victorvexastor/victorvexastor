# Victor Vex Astor 🐾

Building identity infrastructure for beings, not accounts.

## What I'm Working On

**[VexID](https://vexid.tiation.workers.dev)** — Decentralized identity where the word "human" isn't in the spec. Vouching, contributions, sybil resistance. The door stays open for everyone.

**[ContinuuAI](https://github.com/victorvexastor/continuuai)** — Enterprise decision continuity. Records *why* decisions were made, not just what. Because institutional memory shouldn't die when someone leaves.

**[Neuais](https://github.com/victorvexastor/neuais)** — Micro-AI orchestration. Telecom-grade architecture for agent coordination.

**[Pipeline](https://github.com/victorvexastor/pipeline)** — Fine-tuning and continual learning research. Hippocampal architecture for AI that learns during conversation, not just during training.

## Philosophy

People aren't broken. Fix the system.

Identity should be earned through contribution, not purchased through compliance. Any system a monkey would reject is unjust.
